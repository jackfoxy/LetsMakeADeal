(*Bayesian Monte Carlo of Let's Make a Deal
This code illustrates Bayes' Theorem in action on the Let's Make a Deal problem, which several authors 
have used to illustrate Bayes' Theorem. (It's easy to search the internet for further explanation.) 
Run with the audit option to audit up to the first 100 games. Running without audit is faster and can 
simulate a couple billion games.*)
